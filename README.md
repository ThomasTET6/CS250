**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

Understanding user needs are interpreted by paying close attention to what people are actually trying to accomplish. I try to imagine how they interact with a system day to day, and where the friction points might be. User stories help turn those observations into something actionable. By writing features from the user’s perspective, user stories keep the focus on real-world goals. They make it easier to prioritize and design solutions that are meaningful, not just functional.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

When I start developing a program, I like to break the problem into smaller parts and figure out each piece individually. Then I can integrate all of the pieces together an troubleshoot from there. In the future, I want to incorporate Agile practices such as sprint planning and user story mapping to help organize and prioritize the features I plan to add to a program before development begins. Listing features and then sorting them by importance seems like a valuable practice that can guide decision-making throughout the entire development cycle. I like how Agile focuses on progress through small, steady improvements, with feedback guiding each step.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

Being a good team member in software development means showing up with both technical skill and a team-first mindset. It's about writing solid code that follows best practices and is easy for other team members to work with. It is also about being open to feedback and willing to support others. I think it's important to communicate clearly and offer help when someone’s stuck. A strong team is built on trust and respect, and I try to contribute to that by staying collaborative and focused on shared goals.
